            <p>The village of Ha Kome is situated in the foothills of the majestic Maluti Mountains.

            <p>The Maloti Mountains are a mountain range of the highlands of the kingdom of Lesotho. They extend for about 100 km into the South African Free State. The Maloti Range is part of the Drakensberg system that includes ranges across large areas of South Africa. The mountains form a continuous upland area of rounded peaks with incised deep valleys on the flanks, which drain into the Senqu River. Snow and frost may be found even in summer on the highest peaks.</p>

The pass is synonymous with adventure because of its remote locale and the white-knuckle rides it takes to get to the top. Peaking at 2,876 m above sea level, it is also aptly referred to as the Roof of Africa.</p>
